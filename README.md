# Race and Incarceration In America

## Introduction and Overview
The United States' criminal justice system is a large complicated machine that seeks to deliver justice when an offense has been committed. This system has been slowly evolving as our society and culture have been changing. Many things that Americans take as natural in our criminal justice systems are quite abnormal among justice systems worldwide. Since the 1990s, America has seen a drastic increase in the incarcerated population, despite a sharp decrease in crime [[1](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html)]. Many Americans may believe that this drastic increase in incarceration is a result of increased rates of crime, and that this heightened rate is natural and just. To many, it is unclear who is most affected by this drastic change in the application of justice in America, and even more unclear is how they are so affected.

There is a lot of existing research exploring incarceration and the criminal justice system. There is a consensus that America incarcerates a larger proportion of its population than any other nation and that people of color are disproportionately affected by this high incarceration rate [[2](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/world/americas/23iht-23prison.12253738.html)].

In this project I am interested in exploring the ways in which the law is being applied differently to people in America. I will explore different ways to quantify claims about mass incarceration and racial bias. I will also be examining things that factor into sentence length including the offense committed and race. There are many things that contribute to sentence length, however the scope of this project is limited to these factors.

# Ensemble Classification as an Effective Method ofDetermining Racial Bias in Incarceration Data
## Abstract
Machine Learning is becoming a more prevalent tool in the world of criminal justice. Often it is used to predict who will commit a crime or where crimes may occur. Seldom is it used to regulate the criminal justice system, however. In this report I examine prison inmate data and determine what machine learning techniques are effective at detecting the racial bias that has been shown to exist in this data. In this report I find that ensemble methods, especially LightGBM, are effective in classifying inmates by race, thus showing that racial bias is detectable by machine learning techniques and that machine learning is an effective tool in determining if criminal justice reform should be considered.
