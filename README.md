# Incarceration In America

## Introduction
The united states criminal justice system is large complicated machine that seeks to deliver justice when an offense has been committed. This system has been slowly evolving as our society and culture have changed. Many things that Americans take as natural in our criminal justice systems are quite abnormal among justice systems worldwide. Since the 1990s, America has seen a drastic increase in the incarcerated population. Many Americans believe that this drastic increase in incarceration is a result to increased rates of crime, and that this heightened rate is natural and just. To many it is unclear who is most affected by this drastic change in the application of justice in America. It is also unclear how they are so affected.

There is a lot of existing research exploring incarceration and the criminal justice system. There is a consensus that America incarcerates a larger proportion of its population than any other nation and that people of color are disproportionately affected by this high incarceration rate.

In this project I am interested in understanding more about the criminal justice system and the ways in which the law is being applied differently to people in America. I will explore different ways to quantify claims about mass incarceration and race. I will also be examining things that factor into sentence length. The factors I will be examining are: offense, age, race, gender, and admission date. There are many things that contribute to sentence length, however the scope of this project is limited to these factors.
