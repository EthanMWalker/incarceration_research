\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Machine Learning is becomeing a more prevelant tool in the world of
criminal justice. Often it is used to predict who will commit a crime or
where crimes may occur. Seldom is it used to regulate the criminal
justice system, however. In this project I examine prison inmate data
and determine what machine learning techniques are effective at
detecting the racial bias that has been shown to exist in this data. In
this report I find ---------

\section{Problem Statement and
Motivation}\label{problem-statement-and-motivation}}

Last semester I took a look a data set containing the information of
more than 7.5 million individuals that have been processed by the
criminal justice system. I found that racial minorities were more likely
to receive extreme sentences, agreeing with existing research around
bias in the criminal justice system. In this project I will be exploring
the data from a machine learning perspective. My goal is to determine if
this data can be classified in such a way that is predictive of race.
The idea is that perhaps racial bias can be detected in various systems
by seeing how effective different machine learning techniques are at
classifying an inmate's by race given their data.

This is an unconventional way to approach criminal justice data with
machine learning. Often we see machine learning being used to attempt to
determine who might be a criminal or where crimal activity may occur
using social media data and other public information, which may include
data the government owns, but which is not available to te public. These
approaches often ignore or discount the ways that these techniques may
disproportionately affect people of color and the poor. Many
organizations have made official statements reguarding the use of
machine learning in this way, often called predicitive policing. The
ACLU for example released a statement listing civil rights related
concerns about predicitive policing which was signed by several civil
rights origanizations includeing the NAACP
\href{https://www.aclu.org/other/statement-concern-about-predictive-policing-aclu-and-16-civil-rights-privacy-racial-justice}{{[}1{]}}.

My objective is to go against the predictive policing paradigm and use
machine learning to benefit these negatively affected classes of people
by using machine learning as a diagnostic tool. If it can be shown that
certain machine learning techniques are effective at classifying inmates
by race given incarceration related information, then we can inform
policies that will attempt to correct for these systemic racial biases.

\subsection{Source and Credibility}\label{source-and-credibility}}

The data that I will be using in this analysis is from one source. It is
a
\href{https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sentenced-inmates-in-correctional-facilities}{database}
hosted on \href{https://www.data.gov}{Data.gov} and maintained by the
State of Connecticut Department of Corrections. This source is highly
credible because it is a primary source for the data. This organization
is an official government agency which collects, maintains, and reports
on this data.

\hypertarget{gathering-and-cleaning}{%
\subsection{Gathering and Cleaning}\label{gathering-and-cleaning}}

All the data which I am using in this report are freely available to the
public. Collection and cleaning was relatively simple as the source data
was well maintained. The file that I obtained from the Connecticut
Department of Corrections is a very well maintained database. The
largest issue I had with this file was mild inconsistency with the way
in which certain data was encoded (ex. race was encoded as both
\texttt{WHITE} and \texttt{WHITE\textbackslash{}t}). The file is

\begin{verbatim}
individuals.csv.
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{about-the-data}{%
\subsection{About the Data}\label{about-the-data}}

This data set contains individual information for 7.77 million people
that have been processed by the justice system and recorded by the
Connecticut Department of Corrections. Each individual is recorded along
with their age, gender, race, offense, and sentence length, among other
things.

Because there is so much to consider in what is found in the data set, I
chose not to feature engineer as to avoid unneeded complexity.

The sample sizes among different races that are found in the Connecticut
Department of Justice data are not similar. The sample size for American
Indians and Asians is much smaller than that of Whites, Hispanics, and
Blacks, hence we may see some irregular outcomes in the analysis related
to these racial groups.

Before I begin discussing the methods that I did use, I will talk about
some of the methods that I did not use. There are manay techniques that
are not applicable to this data. For example, since this data set is not
a time series models like ARMA and HMM are not applicable here.

\hypertarget{dimension-reduction}{%
\subsection{Dimension Reduction}\label{dimension-reduction}}

A method that I attempted to use, but found little success with were
dimension reduction tools like PCA, T-SNE, and UMAP. This dimension
reduction would have been helpful, especially because once one-hot
encoded this data becomes extremely high dimensional. However PCA,
T-SNE, and UMAP all failed to create meaningful clusters, so I abandoned
the the pursuit of clustering early on. Perhaps some kernel methods
would have been helpful in this endeavor, however I could not find a
kernel that could create a metric on crimes and I dp not feel qualified
to write one myself.

Below I have images of my attempt to use PCA, T-SNE, and UMAP to cluster
the data. It is apperent that it simply is not effective.

    \hypertarget{ensamble-methods}{%
\subsection{Ensamble Methods}\label{ensamble-methods}}

Ensamble methods seemed imediately like the methods that I should be
using in this project. I did not intially expect to successfully
classify this data, however as I learned about how ensamble classifiers
worked I became more confident that I would get decent results.

The primary reason that I though I would not get good results has to do
with how I identified racial bias in the data. In my previous project I
determined that there was racial bias in the criminal justice system
based on the kurtosis of the distribution of sentence lenghts, when you
block inmates by race. Interpreted this means that minorities are much
more likely to receive an extreme sentence length than a white person
is. This condition is very subtle and I did not think that it would be
easily detectable by machine learning methods. However, ensamble methods
only need each member to do slightly better than random, so there was
hope that I could get good results with these methods.

The methods that I attempted were the following: random forrest
classifier, gradient descent boosted classifier, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

    \hypertarget{lightgbm}{%
\subsubsection{LightGBM}\label{lightgbm}}

LightGBM is an attempt to improve upon the efficiency, both temporally
and spatially, of different grandient boosted decision tree (GBDT)
algorithms such as XGBoost. This algoritm was developed by a team at
Microsoft and it uses two novel techniques to imporove GBDT algorithms.
The baseline comparison used was against XGBoost, since the team found
this method to be the best performer of the commonly used GBDT
algorithms.

By analyzing GBDT algorithms the team found that the most expensive
parts of the process is learning the decision trees and the most
expensive part of learning the decision trees is finding the best split
points. They decided to use a histogram based approach for efficiency.
This process is dominated by the histogram building which has a
complexity of \(O(\#data \times \#feature)\). Now the goal is to reduce
the feature number or the number of data points.

\hypertarget{gradient-based-one-side-sampling}{%
\paragraph{Gradient-based One-Side
Sampling}\label{gradient-based-one-side-sampling}}

This is the first novel technique proposed by the Microsoft team. It is
a sampling method that is meant to reduce the number of data instances
while maintaing accuracy. The main idea here is that data points with
small gradient are usually ignored, since the model is already will
trained on those data instances. However, the changes that occur by
ignoring the data will small gradient may reduce the accuracy of the
model once it is learned. Therefore GOSS examines all of the high
gradient data and a random sample of the small gradient data. This
method can maximize the amount of relevent data used in the training of
the model without handicapping the accuracy completely.

\hypertarget{exclusive-feature-bundling}{%
\paragraph{Exclusive Feature
Bundling}\label{exclusive-feature-bundling}}

This is the second novel technique and its goal is to reduce the number
of features. This technique relies on the fact that high dimensional
data tend to be sparse, and therefore there are likely large bundles of
features that are mutually exclusive are nearly mutually exclusive.
These features can be bundled into a single feature and their histograms
can be combined. This reduces the complexity of building histograms from
\(O(\#data \times \#feature)\) to \(O(\#data \times \#bundle)\) and if
\(\#bundle << \#feature\) then the total complexity is greatly reduced.

\hypertarget{random-forest-classifier}{%
\subsection{Random Forest Classifier}\label{random-forest-classifier}}

The random forest classifier was an easy place to begin in my attempt to
find a successful classifier. It is a simple method and would likely
give me a good lower bound on the success that I would have.

In using the random forest classifier I did a gridsearch for the best
parameters. The parameters I decided to seach over are the number of
trees in the classifier and the maximum depth of the trees in the
classifier. I chose this because having more trees in the classifier
will improve the accuracy, however if the depth of each of the trees in
unbounded then overfitting of the individual trees may become an issue.

In my gridsearch I found the best parameters to be the following

    My results with the random forest classifier were rather disappointing,
especially given the amount of time it took to train which was 5.32
hours on the following parameter grid

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{param_grid }\OperatorTok{=}\NormalTok{ \{}
    \StringTok{'n_estimators'}\NormalTok{: np.arange(}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{5100}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{500}\NormalTok{),}
    \StringTok{'max_depth'}\NormalTok{: np.arange(}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

which amounts to a 100 parameter grid.

The out-of-box score was rather promising at .70 however the method
scored barely better than chance. Here is a scoring of the model I ran:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

    \end{Verbatim}

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
score on a test size of 500000 is 0.286044

    \end{Verbatim}

    The scoring here is lackluster to say the least though it did give me
hope for more complex methods to preform better.

\hypertarget{gradient-descent-boosted-classification}{%
\subsection{Gradient Descent Boosted
Classification}\label{gradient-descent-boosted-classification}}

This method is an obvious next step after a random forest. With the
ability to alter the subsample rate and the learning rate, I expect to
get better results with this model. I began by doing another grid
search, but I used some of the results from the previous search on the
random forest model to save time. Fitting the following grid

\begin{Shaded}

    Note that a max depth \textless{}= 0 indicates that the depth is
unbounded. Searching over this grid of size 4000 is something that I
would have never even tried for XGBoost or any other GBDT method, though
it still did take slightly more than 20 hours to fit
