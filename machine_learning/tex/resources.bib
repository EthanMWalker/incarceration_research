    annotate={This report uses data and analysis of the time to understand the racial disparity in drug arrests.The main point of information that I am using is the figure quoted on page 7, claiming that the racial representation disparity is between 23\% and 13\%. Blacks, at the time made up 36\% of drug related arrests but only represented 13\% of drug users. The 26\% figure comes from an analysis of drug related behavior that lead to a greater chance of arrest, to which black drug users are partial.}
